* Pluggable
* Async
* Scalable
* Secure

Why another CI system?

Open Source CIs are lacking basic features. I want to build a system that is easy to develop in and encourages code that is easy to read and write.

Jenkins is the leader in this area but only supports Groovy dialects in its DSL.

I want to allow developers to use Golang or JS to write their plugins.
